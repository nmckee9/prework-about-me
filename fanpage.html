    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
        Adding a heavier beat but keeping the "dreamy" side of indie electronica intact, Seattle duo ODESZA formed in 2012 just before they graduated from Western Washington University. Members Harrison Mills (aka Catacombkid) and Clayton Knight (aka Beaches Beaches) had known each other since they were freshman at the college, but ODESZA didn't form until their senior year. After graduation, things began to move quickly as 2012 saw the release of their debut album, Summer's Gone. The year 2013 saw both an EP, My Friends Never Die, plus a tour with, and a remix for, Pretty Lights. A year later they released In Return, an LP from the Counter Records label that topped various online retailers' electronic album charts. ODESZA toured North America in support of their album, and sold out 28 shows in addition to performing at over 20 festivals. In 2015, the duo launched Foreign Family Collective in order to give exposure to up-and-coming musicians and graphic artists. A deluxe edition of In Return, including the Little Dragon collaboration "Light," as well as live tracks and instrumentals, appeared later in the year. "Late Night" and "Line of Sight," the first two singles from ODESZA's third studio album, were released in April of 2017. A Moment Apart arrived the following September, featuring guest appearances by Regina Spektor, Leon Bridges, and Ry X. The band spent the remainder of the year touring in support of the album before releasing the single "Higher Ground" in early 2018.
